                <h2> About the Developer</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm Brian from New York, New York and am currently studying to becoming a Full Stack Developer at Modern Developer.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Outside of studying at MD, I tutor for the GRE and sell tea and teaware in China. In the past I've also worked as a research assistant, fast food cashier, book shelver, IT assistant, and English teacher. Once I complete my MD studies, I hope to work at a small company or freelance as a full stack dev.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In my personal time, I enjoy reading, studying Chinese, and hiking. If time permits, I also enjoy kicking back and watching a soccer match or baseball game with friends.
                </p>
